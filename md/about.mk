  Passionate about open source, the idea of **Marks** came after using Markdown for documentation for a long time. 

  I always wished I could do more, to be able to use it to create websites, or stylized documentation, blogs etc...
  The lack of stylization possibilities often frustrated me, and the difficulty to extend the language in a simple way too. 

  I decided to make my contribution in order to offer new possibilities in this field.
